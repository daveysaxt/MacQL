Newly contributed code should be licensed GPL with additional special
permissions:

-  to link and use with UQLX code under the terms of the old COPYRIGHT. 
   This is probably necessary because older contributions were made under
   the old copyright.

-  to link with any 3rd party library or emulation engine which is licensed
   under any OSDL approved "open source" license.
